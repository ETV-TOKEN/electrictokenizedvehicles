# electrictokenizedvehicles
It is a pride for us to present to you the ETV token (Electric Tokenized Vehicles Token) Currently we already have 4 motorcycles and in the next few days a brand new car (both 100% electric-zero emissions) that will start from december 2021 to provide parcel service in alliance with a very old national company in Ecuador. Our mission is to replace gasoline-powered vehicles with electric vehicles (using Blockchain technology), all tokenized electric vehicles will provide transportation-related services within the planet, in the following years we will include more electric motorcycles, Drones, Volocopters, Automobiles, as well as any other electric vehicle to our tokenized vehicles fleet. 
Thanks for the oportunity and for helping us to make this a operational development.
